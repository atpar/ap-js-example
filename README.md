# AP Typescript SDK Demo

Consider this project the "hello, world" for the [AP SDK](https://github.com/atpar/ap-monorepo). In this example we will walk through the process of creating and issuing an ACTUS protocol compliant financial instrument on a public ethereum blockchain.

## Setup

Install node modules

    npm install

Start a local ethereum testnet:

    npm run start:chain


## Run the full example

Run the `index.js` node script with the following command:

    npm start


For more documentation on how to use the AP SDK please refer to the [Actus Protocol Docs](https://docs.actus-protocol.io/guides/getting-started)
