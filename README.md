# AP.js Demo

Consider this project the "hello, world" for the [AP.js Library](https://github.com/atpar/ap-monorepo/tree/master/packages/ap.js). In this example we will walk through the process of creating and issuing an ACTUS protocol compliant financial instrument on a public ethereum blockchain.

## Setup

First, you will need to set up your web3 wallet accounts to use as actors for this example. Use the below script to generate and store a list of accounts.

    # this will create a wallet.json file and print a list of your addresses
    npm run generate-wallet

You will need to fund the primary address you plan on using for this example with Goerli Testnet ETH to pay for transaction gas costs. You can find a goerli faucet [here](https://goerli-faucet.slock.it/).


## Run the full example

After funding the wallet you can run the full example with the command:

    npm start
